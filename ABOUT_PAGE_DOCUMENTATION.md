## NASA Dataset Cards

Each dataset card includes:
- **Visual**: Placeholder image (auto-generates SVG if image not found)
- **Badge**: "NASA" badge with database icon
- **Name**: Full dataset name and acronym
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the dataset and its use
- **Features**: 4 key capabilities listed with checkmarks
- **Link**: Direct link to official NASA dataset page with external link icon

## Image Placeholders

The page uses graceful fallback for NASA dataset images. If images are not found, it automatically generates a green-themed SVG placeholder with "NASA Dataset" text.

### Recommended Images to Add:
Place these in `/frontend/public/` directory:
1. `nasa-power.jpg` - Solar panels or weather data visualization
2. `nasa-smap.jpg` - Soil moisture satellite imagery
3. `nasa-modis.jpg` - Vegetation/crop satellite view
4. `nasa-gpm.jpg` - Precipitation/rainfall visualization

You can download official images from each NASA dataset's website or use agricultural satellite imagery.

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full multi-column layouts with side-by-side content
- **Tablet**: Adjusted grid layouts
- **Mobile**: Single-column stacked design, optimized for touch

## SEO & Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images (with fallback)
- External link indicators
- Color contrast compliance

## Integration with Existing Platform
- Uses MixedRoute (accessible without login)
- Consistent with Nibaron theme colors
- Matches existing navigation structure
- Includes CTAs to signup and marketplace

## Next Steps

To complete the About page setup:

1. **Add NASA Dataset Images** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Download images and place in frontend/public/
   - nasa-power.jpg
   - nasa-smap.jpg
   - nasa-modis.jpg
   - nasa-gpm.jpg
   ```

2. **Test the Page**:
   - Navigate to `/about`
   - Click on NASA dataset links (they open in new tabs)
   - Test responsive design on mobile
   - Verify all animations work

3. **Update Navigation**:
   If you want to add the About page to your main navigation, update your header component to include a link to `/about`.
