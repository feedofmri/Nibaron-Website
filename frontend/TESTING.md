# Testing PreOrders Public Access

## Issue: Still redirecting to login page

## Root Cause Analysis:
The redirect is happening because:
1. Old/expired tokens might be stored in localStorage from previous sessions
2. AuthContext tries to validate these tokens on page load
3. This causes 401 errors and potential redirect behavior

## Solution Steps:

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data
Open your browser's Developer Console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

This will:
- Remove any old tokens
- Remove user data
- Reload the page fresh

### Step 2: Test in Incognito/Private Mode
1. Open a new Incognito/Private window
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/pre-orders (or your dev server URL)
3. The page should load WITHOUT redirecting to login
4. You should see 4 sample pre-orders

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
The page should now:
- âœ… Load immediately for logged-out users
- âœ… Show sample pre-orders
- âœ… Display a blue banner saying "Browse Sample Pre-Orders"
- âœ… NOT redirect to login page

## If Still Having Issues:

Check your browser console for:
1. Any 401 errors
2. The message: "ðŸ”’ API Authentication Error (401)"
3. Any navigation/redirect logs

Then report back what you see in the console.
